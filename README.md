This extension is not interested in your personal data nor tracking your activity nor invading by any means your privacy. It just does what it says.

I realized there was not a fast way to kill all cookies for the current site from Google Chrome when I first built this extension at the beginning of 2010. Incredibly enough six years later I found people still using it so I decided to open source it and make it a little bit more user friendly.<br />

As a developer I need this feature to rapidly troubleshoot sites I am working on. The name "Remove Cookies for Site" is inspired in a Firefox extension I used when my main development browser was Firefox.

You can download the extension from <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/lmfdblomdpkcniknaenceeogpgepocmm">here</a>. I hope you will find it useful.<br />

The official source code can be found in <a href="https://github.com/nestoru/remove-cookies-for-site">Github</a>.
